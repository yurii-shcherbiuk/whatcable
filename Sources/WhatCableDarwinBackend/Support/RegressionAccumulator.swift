///
/// This is a pure value type (no IOKit, no @MainActor) so it is
/// unit-testable with synthetic sample sequences.
///
/// ## Per-cable reset
/// On each call to `append(portSamples:)` we pick the "primary" port (highest
/// negotiated current) and form a ContractFingerprint from its
/// configuredVoltage + configuredCurrent. When the fingerprint changes, we
/// clear the sample buffer and start a settle countdown. This fires on cable
/// swap, charger swap, or any PD renegotiation.
///
/// ## Transient rejection
/// The first `settleSkipCount` ticks after a contract change are discarded.
/// At a 1s poll rate this gives a ~5s settle window, covering the PD
/// renegotiation handshake (typically 3-5s). The countdown ticks on every
/// call regardless of whether a usable sample is found, so the window is
/// wall-clock based rather than sample-count based.
