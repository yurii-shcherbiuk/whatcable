/// backend and attached to the matching DisplayPort node.

/// Why this exists, in plain terms: a monitor's EDID (the spec sheet it sends
/// down the cable) can fail to describe its own best mode. Apple 5K/6K displays
/// declare their native mode in a part of the EDID our parser doesn't read, so
/// from EDID alone WhatCable sees a 4K-or-smaller mode and mislabels them
/// (issue #249). And when a display reaches its top mode via compression (DSC),
/// the link rate alone can't confirm it's at full quality (issue #246).
/// macOS already knows the true mode, so we read it straight from CoreGraphics.
///
/// `width` / `height` are **physical pixels** (a Retina 5K display is 5120 x
/// 2880 here, not its 2560-point logical size). Pure value type, no platform
