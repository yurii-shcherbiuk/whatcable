/// The display sibling of `ChargingDiagnostic` (power) and

/// bandwidth for its best picture, and if not, where is the limit?"
///
/// **Honest altitude.** This dimension is genuinely weaker as an automatic
/// bottleneck-namer than power was, and the type is shaped to say so. Power
/// had three independently measured numbers (charger / cable / negotiated).
/// Here the only "delivered" number we get is the *current* link state
/// (`laneCount x rate`), and a DisplayPort link trains itself down to satisfy
/// whatever mode is on screen right now, to save power. So a link carrying
/// less than the monitor's top mode might mean "the cable/adapter can't do
/// more" OR "the user simply hasn't selected the higher mode, so the GPU
/// trained a lazy link." From passive current-state IOKit data we cannot tell
/// those apart.
///
/// Therefore:
/// - `.fine` is the one confident, unambiguous verdict. If the current link
///   already carries the monitor's top mode, there is definitively no link
///   bottleneck. Lead with this.
/// - `.belowMonitorMax` is **informational, not accusatory**. It states both
///   explanations and never declares the cable guilty.
/// - `.adapterLimit` flags that a USB-C -> HDMI/DVI/VGA converter is in the
///   chain, so a shortfall can't be pinned on the cable.
/// - `.unknownMode` when the link is live but the monitor's EDID is
///   unreadable: report what the link is doing, blame nothing.
///
/// Phase wording is deliberately plain (not `String(localized:)`) while the
/// copy is under review; it moves to the localised bundle once approved,
/// matching how `DataLinkDiagnostic` was handled.
